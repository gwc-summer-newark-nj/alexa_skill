# Exercise 4

## Overview

This exercise is open-ended. It is time for you to customize your Alexa skill. Is there other information you want to return? Should Alexa respond differently? Be creative?
Ask questions? Is there something you want your skill to do but you don't know how to get started, then also please ask! 

The following are some ideas if you are stuck, otherwise, you are free to come up with other ideas and implement them!

1. The summary response contains html tags. Can you clean up the response? Hint: There is a function `clean_html` contained in the python lambda code. 
2. The summary doesnâ€™t always sound good or it is too long. How could you fix it?
3. How could you clean up  the tv times? Can you convert the time to 12 hour time instead of military time? 
4. Some shows are on everyday of the week. Can your skill handle that case?
5. Customize the responses to how you think Alexa should respond, what makes sense to you?
6. Do the interaction model sample utterance make sense? Are there additional utterances that you think would be better?i


Looking forward to seeing what you come up with!
